## PROJECT INTRODUCTION
As you might already know TrackTerra is a tax and reporting application. It is build to ease the process of transforming the blocks/transactions data into a single transaction form similar to traditional banking systems. It currently supports native send/recieve, anchor, mirror(partially), pylon(partialy) protocols. 

## PROPOSAL
This proposal is to further develop the application in order to
- Add support for more protocols
- Add support for different taxing software when exporting the data
- Add support for REST and GraphQL to query the applcation(Limited)

The major activities include redesiging the core functionality of the system which is the indexer to support the addition of new protocols dynamically.
